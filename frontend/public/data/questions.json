      "explanation": "CloudWatch ServiceLens integrates X-Ray traces with CloudWatch metrics and logs, providing correlated views for troubleshooting. Contributor Insights identifies top contributors (like specific users or endpoints) to issues. Application Insights uses ML to automatically detect problems. X-Ray service map visualizes dependencies and performance. This provides comprehensive observability for root cause analysis. Metrics alone don't provide full context. Manual correlation doesn't scale. Third-party tools may not integrate as well with AWS services.",
