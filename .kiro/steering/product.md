## 3. KiroWeenのハッカソンの概要

### 🎃 Welcome to Kiroween 👻

This Halloween, we’re kicking off our first-ever Kiroween hackathon. Experience how Kiro, our AI-powered IDE, can help you build out your spookiest, most creative, monstrous ideas. Whether you’re bringing dead tech back to life, stitching together something unexpected, or creating a UI that will give your users nightmares, Kiro will partner with you every step of the way. From brainstorming in natural conversation to building robust, spec-driven systems, Kiro handles the heavy lifting so you can focus on the magic.

For the love of building, or maybe the love of darkness, come craft something wicked and show us how you use Kiro’s features to push boundaries: vibe code in chat, add structure with specs, customize workflows with hooks or steering, or bring in new capabilities with MCP. Your creation will be judged on its potential value, implementation of Kiro, and creativity. 

This is your moment to create something unforgettable. Get inspired by Kiroween’s special spooky factor, summon your ideas, and git commit to the darkness.

### What to Build

Entrants must build a working software application that uses Kiro (vibe coding, agent hooks, steering docs, MCP, or specs) and submit it into one of the following categories:

- Categories:
  - Resurrection:   
    Bring your favorite dead technology back to life. Reimagine obsolete tech with today’s innovations or solving tomorrow's problems.

  - Frankenstein:   
    Stitch together a chimera of technologies into one app. Bring together seemingly incompatible elements to build something unexpectedly powerful.

  - Skeleton Crew:   
    Build a skeleton code template lean enough to be clear but flexible enough to support various use cases. Show us its versatility with two distinct applications from your foundation.

  - Costume Contest:   
    Build any app but show us a haunting user interface that’s polished and unforgettable. Bring in spooky design elements that enhance your app’s function.

What to Submit
Provide a URL to your open source code repository for judging and testing. 

The code repository must be public with an approved OSI Open Source License

Your repo must contain the /.kiro directory at the root of the project to show usage of specs, hooks, and steering. Do NOT add the /.kiro directory or sub-folders to your .gitignore, as this could disqualify your submission.

For Skeleton Crew projects only: Your repo must contain 2 separate repo folders for the 2 separate applications.

Provide a URL to your functional application(s)

You can provide login credentials in public code repo

Include a three (3) minute demonstration video of your submission. Videos must be uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, or Facebook Video and made public and judges are not required to watch beyond 3 minutes.

Identify which category and bonus category you are submitting into.

Provide a write up on how Kiro was used. Judges must understand how effectively you used Kiro to develop your project. Show us your next-level understanding of Kiro features, e.g.:

Vibe coding: How did you structure your conversations with Kiro to build your project? What was the most impressive code generation Kiro helped you with?

Agent hooks: What specific workflows did you automate with Kiro hooks? How did these hooks improve your development process?

Spec-driven development: How did you structure your spec for Kiro to implement? How did the spec-driven approach improve your development process? How did this compare to vibe coding?

Steering docs: How did you leverage steering to improve Kiro’s responses? Was there a particular strategy that made the biggest difference?

MCP: How did extending Kiro’s capabilities help you build your project? What sort of features or workflow improvements did MCP enable that otherwise would have been difficult or impossible?

Please check the Official Rules for full details.

Stage One) The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the ideas meet a baseline level of viability, in that the Project reasonably fits the theme and reasonably applies the required APIs/SDKs featured in the Hackathon.

Stage Two) All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two based on the following equally weighted criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):

Entries will be judged on the following equally weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the judges:

- Potential Value

Includes the extent to which the solution can be widely useful, easy to use, accessible, etc. Examples of considerations could include:

- How unique or saturated the market is with these kinds of applications/solutions
- Whether the UI is intuitive and brings the app functionality to the next level
- If there is a clear need, extensibility, or other type of scalability of the Project
- Implementation

Includes how well the idea is leveraging Kiro. Judges must understand how effectively Kiro was used to develop the project. Examples of effective usage include but are not limited to:

- The variety of Kiro features/capabilities impactful in project development
- The depth of understanding or benefit gained from a given Kiro feature/capability
- The amount of experimentation and strategic decisions made in how Kiro features/capabilities are brought into the individual’s development workflow.

  
  

- Quality and Design

Includes creativity, originality, and polished design of the project, such as:

- Finding and using unique public resources like datasets
- Solving a challenge in a unique way
- Building in delightful UI experiences or other thoughtful choices

The scores from the Judges will determine the potential winners of the applicable prizes. The Entrant(s) that are eligible for a Prize, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Prize.The Judges also have discretion to award up to 2 additional discretionary Influencer Judges Choice prizes based on the same criteria.

Tie Breaking

For each Prize listed below, if two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions’ scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.
